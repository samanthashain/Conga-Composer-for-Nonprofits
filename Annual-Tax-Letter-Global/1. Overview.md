The goal of this solution is to provide a single button that produces a downloadable file with Tax Letters for all households that donated in the current or prior year (depending on when you run the solution).

The components of the solution include:
- Conga Composer Button (this would exist only in your org)
- SOQL Query (samples include din this folder)
- Sample template file with field mappings (included in this folder)
- Recommended parameters (included in this folder if applicable)
- Companion video (coming soon)

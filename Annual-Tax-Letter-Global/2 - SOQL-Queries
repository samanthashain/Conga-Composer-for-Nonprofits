Conga Composer uses SOQL Queries to pull data into a merge.  To build a Conga Solution for a Global Tax Merge, we need to gather a spreadsheet of every Household that donated in the prior year.

The SOQL query will look something like this (substitute RecordTYpeId for the Household RT Id in your org)

SELECT Id, npo02__OppAmountThisYear__c, npo02__Informal_Greeting__c, npo02__OppsClosedThisYear__c, npe01__SYSTEM_AccountType__c, RecordtypeId 
FROM Account 
WHERE npo02__OppAmountLastYear__c>0 and RecordTypeId='0125f0000008dhCAAQ'

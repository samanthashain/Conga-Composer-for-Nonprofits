Conga Composer uses SOQL Queries to pull data into a merge. To build a Conga Solution for a Donor Profile, we need to gather data from several ojects related to the Account.

Note: {pv0} is nomenclature for substituting the Id of the current Account record into the query

# Closed Won Opportunities
SELECT Amount, CloseDate, Description, Name, Type FROM Opportunity WHERE AccountId = '{pv0}' AND StageName = 'Closed Won' LIMIT 5

# Opportunity Pipeline
SELECT Amount, CloseDate, Description, Name, Type FROM Opportunity WHERE AccountId = '{pv0}' AND (StageName = 'Prospecting' OR StageName= 'Verbal Commitment' OR StageName= 'Cultivation' OR StageName= 'Pledged') LIMIT 5

# Tasks/Activities
SELECT AccountId, ActivityDate, Description, Id, OwnerId, Status, Subject, TaskSubtype, WhatId FROM Task WHERE AccountId = '{pv0}' LIMIT 5

# Affiliated Contacts (use this query for an Organization Record Type)
SELECT npe5__Contact__c, npe5__Description__c, npe5__EndDate__c, npe5__Organization__c, npe5__Primary__c, npe5__Role__c, npe5__StartDate__c, npe5__Status__c, npe5__Contact__r.Description, npe5__Contact__r.Email, npe5__Contact__r.Name FROM npe5__Affiliation__c WHERE npe5__Organization__c = '{pv0}'

# Logo
This requires a logo to be uploaded as a File, as well as creating a custom field here per instructions documented here https://documentation.conga.com/composer/latest/merging-images-from-salesforce-files-143198720.html

SELECT ContentDocument.Latestpublishedversion.Field_Image_URL__c FROM ContentDocumentLink WHERE LinkedEntityId = '{pv0}'

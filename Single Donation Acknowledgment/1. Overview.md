The goal of this solution is to provide a single button that produces a downloadable file with a Donation Acknowledment letter.  The solution also updates NPSP Donation Acknowledgment fields when the merge is completed.

The components of the solution include:
- Conga Composer Button (this would exist only in your org)
- SOQL Query (n/a for this example)
- Sample template file with field mappings (included in this folder)
- Recommended parameters (included in this folder)
- Companion video (coming soon)

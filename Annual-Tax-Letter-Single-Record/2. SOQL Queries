Conga Composer uses SOQL Queries to pull data into a merge.  To build a Conga Solution for a Household Tax Merge, we need to gather a list of that Household's eligible donations.

The SOQL query will look something like this:

SELECT Id, Name, Closedate, Amount 
from OPPORTUNITY 
where Opportunity.AccountId='{pv0}' AND Opportunity.CloseDate=THIS_YEAR

Note: {pv0} is nomenclature for substituting the Id of the current Household record into the query
Note: If you typically run your reports in January, you will update your query to say LAST_YEAR
Note: You may need to include additional filters (record type, checkbox for tax deductible, etc) based on your organization's processes

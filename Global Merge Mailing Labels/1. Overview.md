The goal of this solution is to provide a single button that produces a downloadable file with standard address mailing labels for households that meet certain criteria included in the embedded query.  The solution assumes Avery #5160 (or equivalent) is the most common label size.

Be sure to familiarize yourself with the NPSP Mailing List documentation:  https://powerofus.force.com/s/article/NPSP-Choose-Addr-Mailing-Label-Report

This solution set will enable nonprofits using Conga Mail Merge (product being depricated) to relatively easily move to Conga Composer Global Merge.

Global Merge is a feature that is complimentary (aka free!) if you already have Conga Composer.

The components of the solution include:
- Conga Composer Button (this would exist only in your org)
- SOQL Query (samples included in this folder)
- Sample template file with field mappings (included in this folder)
- Recommended parameters (included in this folder if applicable)
- Companion video (coming soon)
